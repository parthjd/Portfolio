                I had my first encounter with programming back in high school,
                when I built a Student Information Systems software. Curious to
                know more, I started learning on my own, coding different
                languages from home. Passionate and confident about web
                development, I quit my well-paying job in the travel retail
                industry in order to develop digital experiences that leave a
                positive impact on people, environment and the society.
                <br />
                Three months of a successful coding bootcamp later, I feel proud
                to present myself as a <strong>
                  Full Stack Web Developer
                </strong>{" "}
                who specializes in fixing front end as well back end issues with
                ease and accuracy. As a web developer, I strive to do more than
                just developing a website. I aim to serve my clients by
                designing and developing websites that have creative designs and
                powerful features backed by quality content and user
                friendliness. What differentiates me from my contemporaries is
                that instead of creating just a website for my clients, I make
                serious efforts to develop properly crafted experiences and web
                designs for each of my clients.
